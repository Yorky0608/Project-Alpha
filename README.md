# Endless Blade

**Endless Blade** is a 2D platformer that blends classic gameplay with an infinite challenge. Players embark on an endless journey through procedurally generated encounters, facing waves of enemies and powerful bosses that test precision, reflexes, and adaptability.

Each playable character features unique stats and abilities, encouraging different playstyles and strategies with every run. Designed to be easy to pick up but hard to put down, Endless Blade is built around the idea of “just one more run,” rewarding skill, experimentation, and endurance.

Built using **Godot**, **GDScript**, and **GitHub**, the game captures the spirit of traditional 2D platformers while introducing a modern, endless twist.
